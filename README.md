## Introduction
An online doctor appointment booking system can prove to be a boon to doctors and patients alike. For those among us who have seen the waiting room of busy doctors, it will draw memories of patients and their attendants crowding around the receptionist. It was not necessarily first-in and first-out. Many times it was based on who was able to throw their weight around and seize the opportunity to stride in to meet the doctor even before the earlier patient had walked out. In some cases, tokens were given out that represented our number in the queue.

The wait could be quite long and if the patient was not quick to mark her presence when called out it could mean a further wait. Patients being sick, there was always a high probability of the attendants also falling sick as everyone was crowding around each other. This evolved to a telephone-based appointment booking, mainly managed on paper. It was hardly flexible. No-shows were very common. With the advent of Personal Computers, appointments were maintained on the desktop. This certainly brought more orders, however, appointments still required the patient to phone the receptionist to book the appointment. Widespread use of mobile phones and the internet has driven the need for doctors to offer the facility of online appointment booking – a far superior option for both doctors and patients. The aim of this project is to create a system that handles doctor-patient management system that will doctors on their works and will also help the patients to book doctor appointments and view medical progress. 

## System Description
The E-channeling system has a listing of doctors. When a patient needs an appointment urgently but sees that their doctor is fully booked, they may look at the schedules of other available doctors at a specific hospital instead of turning to the competitor. Also, doctors have the ability to check their appointments and patient details using the application.
Administrators act as authorities of the system they have the ability to enter the doctors into the system and handle the patients and the payments, appointments, and maintenance of the system

Doctor Listings
Doctor listings help patients find the doctors with the needed qualifications. The channeling system has an effective filter feature so that patients don’t waste time scrolling through all the doctor profiles. Patients may want to search for specific types of treatment, expertise, positive feedback, location, etc.

Patient Profile
It is not only doctors who have to share information about themselves. Patient profiles also contain their electronic health record, results from various examinations, and lab tests. The administrator has the authority to update and attach documentation to patient profiles. 

### UML Activity Diagram
This E- Channeling  system involved three actors,

## Software design

For the patient

The patient should add some important information to register for the system. Then the patient can login to the system by using the entered email address and the password
